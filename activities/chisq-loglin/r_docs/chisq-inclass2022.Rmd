## General process to analyze categorical outcomes with categorical predictors  
image here: "![Categorical outcome decision process](../images/categorical-process.png)"

## Step 0 - Install a package  
- This activity makes use of two new packages: "janitor" (for data cleaning), and "vcd" (for odds ratio calculation)  

## Step 1 - Import the data   
- we make use of the "janitor" package in this doc  
- allow "na" and "n/a" as missing values  
- create unique id for reach row  
- here's a [link to the tsv file](../data/Dataset-PublicationStatistics-2022.tsv) if you want to check it out on your own  
```{r import}
pub_tib <- readr::read_delim("data/Dataset-PublicationStatistics-2022.tsv",
                           na=c("n/a","na","N/A","NA","Na","N/a",""), delim = "\t",
                           show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%  #fixes the column names
  janitor::remove_empty(which = "rows") %>%  # drop empty rows
  mutate(id = row_number(), .before = 1) %>%   #add a column with id for each row
  mutate(across(where(is.character), str_trim)) %>% #remove trailing/leading whitespace 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), tolower)) %>% #make all text columns lowercase 
  select(-student_name,-citation,-doi) #drop columns that we won't use here
```

## Step 2 - clean the data and set variable types
Check values of our variables:  
    1. binary variables (reported yes/no): store as factor and check levels  
    2. numerical (e.g., participants): convert "no" to NA and store as numerical  
    3. field: since one entry can belong to multiple fields, we create a series of dummy coded variables `soc`,`cog`,`dev`, etc where a row gets a value of 1 if the given field appears in the `field` column. there is some variance in how fields are entered ("social"/"soc", "cognitive"/"cog) so we'll just check for a key part of text for each.  
    4. sample\_size\_justification: store as factor and check levels  
    
```{r clean-data}
#fix typos where "no" was entered as "on"
pub_tib <- pub_tib %>% mutate(
  income_or_ses_reported = str_replace(income_or_ses_reported, pattern = "on", replacement = "no")
)

#1. binary variables - using "factor" instead of "as_factor" because it will put
#   the levels in alpha order - NA values are recoded as "no"
pub_tib <- pub_tib %>% mutate(
  race_ethn_reported = factor(replace_na(race_ethn_reported,"no")),
  income_or_ses_reported = factor(replace_na(income_or_ses_reported,"no")),
  location_reported = factor(replace_na(location_reported,"no")),
  general_sample = factor(replace_na(general_sample,"no")),
  sample_size_justification = factor(sample_size_justification)
)
pub_tib %>% select(race_ethn_reported:general_sample,sample_size_justification) %>% purrr::map(levels)
pub_tib %>% count(race_ethn_reported)
pub_tib %>% count(income_or_ses_reported)
pub_tib %>% count(location_reported)
pub_tib %>% count(general_sample)
pub_tib %>% count(sample_size_justification)


#2. Numerical variables: participants_male and participants_female are stored as chr
#   use parse_number() and any non-numeric values will get NA 
#   but there's an inconsistency in reporting NA/no versus 0 - we would need to 
#   resolve the inconsistency to make use of that data
pub_tib <- pub_tib %>% mutate(
  participants_male = parse_number(participants_male, na = "no"),
  participants_female = parse_number(participants_female, na = "no"),
  participants_nonbin = parse_number(participants_nonbin, na = "no")
) 
pub_tib %>% select(participants_n:participants_nonbin) %>% psych::describe()
#3. check out "field"
pub_tib %>% count(field)  #or use janitor::tabyl(field)
# now dummy code the "field" variable, allowing for multiple fields per entry
pub_tib <- pub_tib %>% 
  mutate(
    soc = if_else(str_detect(field,"soc"), 1, 0),
    cog = if_else(str_detect(field,"cog"), 1, 0),
    dev = if_else(str_detect(field,"dev"), 1, 0),
    pers = if_else(str_detect(field,"pers"), 1, 0),
    conbeh = if_else(str_detect(field,"con"), 1, 0),
    neuro = if_else(str_detect(field,"neuro"), 1, 0),
    quant = if_else(str_detect(field,"quant"), 1, 0),
    other = if_else(str_detect(field,"other"), 1, 0),
    #field_combo = ""
  )
# print counts of each field
pub_tib %>% select(soc:other) %>% colSums(na.rm = TRUE)
# no quant cases so drop that column
pub_tib <- pub_tib %>% select(-quant)

```
## Step 3 - Chi-square test of independence and loglinear analysis  
We can discuss what questions to ask with the data and we can explore as much as we have time for. But let's start with an example that makes use of a contingency table and the chi square test of independence:   

#### Question 1 (chi square test): If a study uses a sample that is meant to represent the general population, is race/ethnicity more likely to be reported?    
- we can test whether `general_sample` and `race_ethn_reported` are related  
    - H<sub>0</sub>: `general_sample` and `race_ethn_reported` are independent
    
1. Generate contingency table    
2. Examine observed frequencies compared to expected frequencies   
3. Chi-squared test of independence  
4. if expected frequency for a cell is 5 or less then use Fisher's exact test  

```{r Q1, fig.show='hold', results='hold'}
# 1. Contingency Table
q1_xtab <- pub_tib %>% 
  with(gmodels::CrossTable(general_sample, race_ethn_reported, expected = TRUE,
                       prop.chisq = TRUE)) #use fisher=TRUE if expected counts <5
# 2. Cramers V (round to 3 decimals)
cat("Cramer's V: ", round(DescTools::CramerV(q1_xtab$t),3), "\n")
# 3. Extra: odds ratio
q1_odds <- vcd::oddsratio(q1_xtab$t, log=FALSE)
cat("odds ratio general_sample and race_ethn_reported")
q1_odds  #interpretation: a general sample publication is YY as likely to report race/ethn than a non-general sample publication
confint(q1_odds) #confidence interval
```

##### Understand the output  
1. total observations - 216 means all cases were included  

2. *N* is the observed joint frequency. For example, out of [how many?] samples that represent the general population, [how many?] of those papers reported race/ethnicity.  
3. *Expected N* is the expected joint frequency.  
4. *Chi-square contribution* measures the amount that a cell contributes to the overall chi-square statistic for the table (the sum of all contributions equals the overall chi-squared value below the table).   
  
##### Answer the following  
1. Are any of the expected counts less than or equal to 5?  
2. Are the observed deviations from expected frequencies likely under the null hypothesis? (χ<sup>2</sup>(1, N = 216) = 13.704, p<.0001).  
3. Examine the observed and expected frequencies. What direction is the association between the categories?  
4. What is the effect size? (Cramers V, odds ratio)  

#### Using the last example as a template, let's ask whether research field and race/ethnicity reporting are related.  
- each publication can only be classified as one field, so we will limit our cases to those that are classified as a single field  
- after limiting cases, there are six categories of research field    

```{r Q1followup, fig.show='hold', results='hold'}
# 0. filter cases to keep only single field pubs
pub_tib <- pub_tib %>% rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(
    issinglefield = if_else(sum(c_across(soc:other))==1,1,0),
  ) %>% ungroup()
pub_singlefield_tib <- pub_tib %>% filter(issinglefield==1) %>% 
  mutate(
    singlefield = case_when(
      soc == 1 ~ "soc",
      cog == 1 ~ "cog",
      dev == 1 ~ "dev",
      neuro == 1 ~ "neuro",
      pers == 1 ~ "pers",
      conbeh == 1 ~ "conbeh",
      other == 1 ~ "other"
    )
  )
pub_singlefield_tib %>% count(singlefield)

# 1. Contingency Table
fieldxrace_xtab <- pub_singlefield_tib %>% 
  with(gmodels::CrossTable(singlefield, race_ethn_reported, expected = TRUE,
                       prop.chisq = TRUE, fisher=TRUE)) #if expected counts <5
# 2. Cramers V (round to 3 decimals)

# 3. Interpretation
```


#### Question 2 (loglinear model): Are reporting of race/ethn, income, and location related?  
- we can test whether `race_ethn_reported`, `income_or_ses_reported`, and `location_reported` are related
    - H<sub>0</sub>: the variables are independent
    
1. Generate contingency table    
2. Convert to dataframe of frequencies  
3. Fit loglin model (using glm(family=poisson))  
4. Compare observed to fitted (predicted) frequencies  
5. Backward elimination (reduce the model)  
    - hypothesis test for reduced model compared to previous model: significant (p<.05) chi-square test indicates that dropping the term in the reduced model significantly worsens the fit of the reduced model (meaning the term should be kept in the model)  
    - hypothesis test for 
6. Visualize

```

##### Based on our log lin modeling, let's answer the following  
1. What is the simplest model that does not differ significantly from the full model?  
    - Freq ~ income_or_ses_reported + location_reported + race_ethn_reported + 
     + income_or_ses_reported:location_reported + race_ethn_reported:income_or_ses_reported  
    - this is the model that includes all two-way interactions except race:location  
2. How can we interpret this result?    
    - we interpret the highest order terms in the model and see that:  
        1. location reporting is increased among publications that report income/ses  
        2. publications that report race also tended to report income   

#### Reporting  

- report the likelihood ratio statistic for the final
model. 
- For any terms that are significant you should report the chi-square change. 
- If you break down any higher-order interactions in subsequent analyses then you need to report the relevant chi-square statistics (and odds ratios). 

For this example we could report:  
The three-way loglinear analysis produced a final model that retained interactions of (a) race reporting by income/ses reporting and (b) location reporting by income/ses reporting. The likelihood ratio of this final model was χ2(2) = 3.222, p = .200, indicating the model did not significantly differ from the observed frequencies. The highest-order interaction (race reporting by income/ses reporting by location reporting) was not significant, (comparison of model without the three-way interaction to the full model: χ2(1) = 0.986, p = .320), and the race/ethnicity-reported by location-reported interaction was not significant (model without this term compared to model with all 2nd-order interactions: χ2(1) = 2.236, p = .135. To break down the associations, separate chi-square tests were performed to examine (a) race/ethnicity reporting by income/ses reporting (combining location reporting categories) and (b) location reporting by income/ses reporting (combining race/ethnicity reporting categories). There was a significant association between race/ethnicity-reported and whether location was reported, χ2(1) = 24.961, p < .0001, odds ratio = 5.325. Furthermore, there was a significant association between income/ses-reported and whether location was reported, χ2(1) = 11.447, p = .001, odds ratio = 4.055. [plots/contingency tables can be used to characterize the two-way associations completely]    

## Finishing up- export the cleaned data files and re-run analyses in SPSS  
    - see [notes on the SPSS analysis](../spss/loglin-inclass2022-spss.html) linked on Canvas, it may be helpful to match up the output from SPSS to our output from the same analysis in R above     
```{r data-export}
pub_tib %>% 
  mutate(
    race_ethn_reported = as.numeric(race_ethn_reported)-1, #factor levels are 1=no, 2=yes
    income_or_ses_reported = as.numeric(income_or_ses_reported)-1, #so we subtract 1
    location_reported = as.numeric(location_reported)-1    #to end up with 0, 1 values
  ) %>% 
  readr::write_csv("data/collab_data_cleaned.csv")
```
